# Brewtiful Brand: Full of Flavor
### Branding for Café Letka
<br><br>
<br><br>
Loved by locals, Café Letka  had _**all the right flavors**_.  
The heart, the vibe, and the loyal crowd.  
  
But when it comes to branding  
—_it’s time to **turn up the heat**._
<br><br>
<br><br>

### Medium Roast
_What's Wrong with Their Branding_ 
<br><br>
<br><br>
When I first stepped inside Café Letka,  
I was genuinely _**amazed**_.  
<br><br>

Set in a historical building with tall ceilings   
and those **_iconic_** blue arched windows.  
  
—the space immediately felt inviting    
and _**full of life**_.
<br><br>
  
The interior had a unique charm.  
Thoughtful blend of **old** and **new**.
  
Ornamental details paired with clean, modern lines  
created their _**striking signature**_ look. 
<br><br>
  
The cozy atmosphere, the quiet hum of conversation,  
and the sense of community made it more than just a café.
  
Letka was a local favorite for _**a reason**_.
<br><br>
Their photography managed to capture glimpses of that charm.  
But beyond the lens, the brand fell like _**lukewarm coffee**_.  
  
No strong identity.   
No aroma that lingered.   
Nothing that truly said: _**“This is Letka.”**_
<br><br>

It was time for **Fresh Cup of Coffee**!
<br><br>
<br><br>
### Sipping on Inspiration
Where I Got My Inspiration From
<br><br>
<br><br>
From the texture of the walls  
to the rhythm of the space,  
Letka brewed a _**feeling**_.
<br><br>
That’s where the inspiration started.
<br><br>
Not with trends or templates,  
but with what made Letka _**Letka**_.
<br><br>

It was all in the details.  
The tall ceilings and layers of history.
Old textures worn into the walls.  

Flowy ornaments and the bold,  
minimal touches.
<br><br>
Letka was a masterclass in contrast.  
Soft and strong.  
Old and new.
<br><br>
And always, the coffee.  
Smooth, rich, comforting.  
With latte art that moved like brushstrokes—flowy, delicate, and intentional.  
<br><br>
Letka didn’t just serve coffee.  
It served a _**feeling**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
### Brewing Bold Ideas  
My Creative Solutions
<br><br>
<br><br>
It all began with the coffee.  
  
From cup to concept, every design choice   
was grounded in what made Letka _**Letka**_.
