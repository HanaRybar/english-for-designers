# Brewtiful Brand: Full of Flavor
### Branding for Café Letka
<br><br>
<br><br>
Loved by locals, Café Letka  had _**all the right flavors**_.  
The warmth, the vibe, and the loyal crowd.  
  
But when it comes to branding  
—_it’s time to **turn up the heat**._
<br><br>
<br><br>

### Medium Roast
_What's Wrong with Their Branding_ 
<br><br>
<br><br>
It didn’t take long to understand that Letka  
_**isn’t just another**_ place to grab a coffee.
<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
Set in a historical building with tall ceilings  
and those _**iconic**_ windows with blue arches.  
<br><br>
The interior had a _unique charm_.  
Thoughtful blend of **old** and **new**.
<br><br>
Ornamental details paired with clean,  
modern lines created their  
_**striking signature**_ look. 
<br><br>
<br><br> 

<br><br>  
The cozy atmosphere, the quiet hum of conversation,  
and the sense of community made it more than just a café.
<br><br> 
Letka is a local favorite for _**a reason**_.
<br><br>

<br><br> 
Their photography managed to capture glimpses of that charm.  
But beyond the lens, the brand felt like _**lukewarm coffee**_.

<br><br> 
<br><br>  
No strong identity.   
No aroma that lingered.   
Nothing that truly said: _**“This is Letka.”**_
<br><br>

It was time for **Fresh Cup of Coffee**!
<br><br>
<br><br>
### Sipping on Inspiration
Where I Got My Inspiration From
<br><br>
<br><br>
From the **texture** of the walls  
to the **rhythm** of the space, that’s where  
the _**inspiration started**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Not with trends or templates,  
but with what made Letka _**Letka**_.
<br><br>

It was all in the _**details**_.  
The tall ceilings and layers of history.  
Old textures worn into the walls.  

Flowy _**ornaments**_ and the bold,  
_**minimal touches**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Letka is a masterclass in _**contrast**_.  
_Soft and strong.  
Old and new._
<br><br>

<br><br>
**And always, the coffee.**  
Smooth, rich, comforting.<br>
  
With latte art that moved like _**brushstrokes**_    
_—flowy, delicate, and intentional._

<br><br>
<br><br>
Letka doesn´t just serve coffee.  
It serves a _**feeling**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
### Brewing Bold Ideas  
My Creative Solutions
<br><br>
<br><br>
It all began with the coffee.  
  
From cup to concept, every design choice   
was grounded in what made Letka _**Letka**_.
