In a world filled with relentless noise — where voices compete for attention and the clamor of consumption drowns out our inner selves — we often find ourselves at a crossroads.

It's this moment we must decide whether to succumb to the pressure or to stay true to ourselves.

**Do what you love.**  
**Do what you believe in.**  
**Do the work you hope may be of some use.**

Because our ideas and actions shape the world around us.

**Slow down.**

People are concerned with how you make it work — not why you make it work.  
People will copy how with no understanding of the why.

*...quality over quantity*

**Don't be bound by the labels, become a paradox.**

Be a writer who builds companies.  
Be an entrepreneur who paints.

Be undefinable.  
Because like in Tetris, if you fit in too well, you disappear.

---

**Let it scare you a little and excite you a lot.**

If you feel safe in the area that you're working in, you're not working in the right area.  
Always go a little further into the water than you feel you are capable of being in.

Go a little bit out of your depth. And when you don't feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you're just in the right place to do something exciting.

— David Bowie

*...strive for self-overcoming*  
*...transcending current limitations to reach higher forms of existence and creativity.*

Evolve into something greater.  
**Be proactive.**
