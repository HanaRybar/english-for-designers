# This Is Not a Bio
<br><br>
_I’m supposed to tell you who I am._  
_Wrap myself in **shiny words** that look neat and polished._
<br><br>
<br><br>
_**Stick yet another label on a cracked screen.**_
<br><br>
<br><br>
_But what happens when the cracks run too deep?_
<br><br>

**This Is Not a Bio.**   
**This Is a Glimpse Beneath The Surface.**

I´m growing up in a world which is _falling apart_.  
It´s easier to deny it. 
<br><br>
<br><br>
_But we all see it everyday - just take a look around._ 
<br><br>
<br><br>
Clearly I´m not the only one who feels this way.  
_**Crisis is on a RISE.**_
