# Brewtiful Brand: Full of Flavor
### Branding for Café Letka
<br><br>
<br><br>
Loved by locals, Café Letka  had _**all the right flavors**_.  
The warmth, the vibe, and the loyal crowd.  
  
But when it comes to branding  
—_it’s time to **turn up the heat**._
<br><br>
<br><br>

### Medium Roast
_What's Wrong with Their Branding_ 
<br><br>
<br><br>
It didn’t take long to understand that Letka  
_**isn’t just another**_ place to grab a coffee.
<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
Set in a historical building with tall ceilings  
and those _**iconic**_ windows with blue arches.  
<br><br>
The interior had a _unique charm_.  
Thoughtful blend of **old** and **new**.
<br><br>
Ornamental details paired with clean,  
modern lines created their  
_**striking signature**_ look. 
<br><br>
<br><br> 

<br><br>  
The cozy atmosphere, the quiet hum of conversation,  
and the sense of community made it more than just a café.
<br><br> 
Letka is a local favorite for _**a reason**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br> 
Their photography managed to capture glimpses of that charm.  
But beyond the lens, the brand felt like _**lukewarm coffee**_.

<br><br> 
<br><br>  
- No strong identity.   
- No aroma that lingered.   
- Nothing that truly said: _**“This is Letka.”**_
<br><br>
<br><br>

It was time for **Fresh Cup of Coffee**!
<br><br>
<br><br>
### Sipping on Inspiration
Where I Got My Inspiration From
<br><br>
<br><br>
From the **texture** of the walls  
to the **rhythm** of the space, that’s where  
the _**inspiration started**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Not with trends or templates,  
but with what made Letka _**Letka**_.
<br><br>

It was all in the _**details**_.  
The tall ceilings and layers of history.  
Old textures worn into the walls.  

Flowy _**ornaments**_ and the bold,  
_**minimal touches**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Letka is a masterclass in _**contrast**_.  
_Soft and strong.  
Old and new._
<br><br>

<br><br>
**And always, the coffee.**  
Smooth, rich, comforting.<br>
  
With latte art that moved like _**brushstrokes**_    
_—flowy, delicate, and intentional._

<br><br>
<br><br>
Letka doesn´t just serve coffee.  
It serves a _**feeling**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
### Brewing Bold Ideas  
My Creative Solutions
<br><br>
<br><br>
It all began with the coffee.    
**A Shot of Creativity**
<br><br>
From cup to concept, every design choice   
was grounded in what made Letka _**Letka**_.
<br><br>
_**The Perfect Blend.**_  
_**Fusion of Creativity and Strategy.**_
<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
Delicate, flowing lines echo the café’s architecture  
and the elegance of latte art.  
A symbol that feels personal — almost hand-crafted.  
<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
Inspired by the architecture — warm, aged textures with character.  
But Letka isn’t just earth tones.  
  
Accents of blue and pink from the window arches and interior details  
bring in softness and contrast.  
  
And then, the yellow — added to bring warmth into the design and the space itself.  
Like sunlight. Like community.  
<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
A balanced mix of serif and sans serif fonts.  
A harmonious contrast.  
_Perfect blend of old and new._
<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
Not just a shape — a message.  
The circle stands for wholeness, for gathering, for time well spent.  
It breaks from the standard menu form —  
just like Letka breaks from the standard café.  
<br><br>
<br><br>
**In the end, the branding didn’t reinvent Letka —  
it revealed it.**  
<br><br>
_Layer by layer.  
Detail by detail.  
A space translated into identity._  
<br><br>
**An identity full of flavor.**
