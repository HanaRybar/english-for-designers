# Design Manifesto

In a world filled with relentless noise‚Äîwhere voices compete for attention and the clamor of consumption drowns out our inner selves  
‚Äîwe often find ourselves at crossroads.

It‚Äôs the moment we must decide whether to succumb to the pressure or to stay true to ourselves.
<br><br>

**Do what you _LOVE._**  
**Do what you _BELIEVE IN._**  
<br><br>
_Because our ideas and actions shape the world around us._

### Slow Down üçÉ

Remember to live.  
All you have is now.

Creating space for ideas requires slowing down and allowing your mind to **_wander._**

### Let It Scare You a Little, and Excite You a Lot  üé¢

Don't do things **_just_** because you think you will get something for it.  
Do what's interesting to you.  

We can't predict the outcome.   

> In the realm of creativity, the outcome can be quite unpredictable.   
> The formula that worked yesterday might fail today.  

<br><br>
To be creative, you have to be in a **_state of play._**   
You can't play if you're being too careful or trying not to make mistakes.  

Be **_curious_** - break the rules, question own beliefs, experiment.   
Do what you can't.

### Don‚Äôt be bound by labels; become a PARADOX ‚ú®  

Be a writer who builds companies.  
Be an entreprenour who paints. 
<br><br>

**_Be undefinable.  
Because like in tetris, if  you fit in too well, you disappear._**

### Understanding Your Why üíñ
**_Why ‚Üí How ‚Üí What_**  

People are concerned with how you make it work - not why you make it work.   
People will copy **_how_** with no understanding of the **_why._**

### Empty the cup üçµ

In order for something new to come, something old must go and that old can sometimes mean   
‚Äîlet go of what you know until know.  

Empty the cup and start from the beginning.

It's not easy to do, but at the moment it's the only way how something that is **_blocked_** can be brought back to **_movement._** 

---

### No Risk, No Story‚ö°

Be the one who goes **_first._**  

Because life rewards those who **_initiate,_** not those who **_wait_** for others to do so.
