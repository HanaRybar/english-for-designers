# This Is Not a Bio
<br><br>
_I’m supposed to tell you who I am._  
_Wrap myself in **shiny words** that look neat and polished._
<br><br>
<br><br>
_**Stick yet another label on a cracked screen.**_
<br><br>
<br><br>
_But what happens when the cracks run too deep?_
<br><br>

**This Is Not a Bio.**   
**This Is a Glimpse Beneath The Surface.**
<br><br>

<br><br>
I´m growing up in a world which is _falling apart_.  
It´s easier to deny it. 
<br><br>
<br><br>
_But we all see it everyday - just take a look around._ 
<br><br>
<br><br>
Clearly I´m not the only one who feels this way.  
_**Crisis is on a RISE.**_
<br><br>

## A Modern Odyssey   
### The Tree of Knowledge Mutation
<br><br>
_What makes us so different from every other species on this planet?_  
_What allowed us to rise above the rest?_
<br><br>
<br><br>
Around 70,000 years ago, something _extraordinary_ happened.  
  
— _**Cognitive Revolution**_
<br><br>
<br><br>
Our ancestors leapt ahead, not because they were the strongest or the fastest,  
but because of their unique ability to create _**fictions**_.
<br><br>  

---
<br><br>  
It's the belief in the same fictions that allow us to work together in **HUGE** numbers.
<br><br> 
<br><br> 
_The shared beliefs that make us believe we’re all part of the same group,  
even when we don’t know each other._
<br><br>
<br><br>
_**Nations, religions, money**—they’re all fictions._
<br><br>

---
<br><br>
_We used our unique minds,   
learned how to tame the wild._   
<br><br>
Our population **BOOMED** as did our _**demands**_.

<br><br>
--- 
<br><br>
### The Lie We Live
<br><br>
We see everything as something to be owned,   
as an object to be sold. 
<br><br>
<br><br>
_We work and work, left with **no time** we work for._ 
<br><br>
<br><br>
Constantly striving to do **MORE**.   
<br><br>

---
<br><br>
Yesterday´s luxuries become today´s necessities.
<br><br>
<br><br>
_Chasing shiny things—**possesions, status, validation**_.  
_This is what it means to be free?_  
<br><br>
<br><br>
Smart enough to do our job, but not to question **WHY** we do it.
<br><br>

---
<br><br>
They gave us _**money**_, and in return we gave them _**the world**_.

<br><br>

<br><br>
### The Burnout Society
<br><br>
For the _**first time**_ in history, more people die  from _**eating too much**_ than from _**eating too little**_.

More people die from _**old age**_ than from _**infectious diseases**_.      

More people _**commit suicide**_ than are _**killed**_ by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
In just a few decades, the world has _shifted_ beneath our feet.  
  
What once took centuries now happens in the _**blink of an eye**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Everyone keeps talking about progress. 
<br><br>
<br><br>
_**So why do things not feel okay?**_
<br><br>

---
<br><br>
Technology has rewired everything—_the way we think, the way we connect, the way we exist_.
  
<br><br>
  
---
<br><br>
Once, information was scarce.   
Now, we’re _**drowning in it**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
_Every scroll, every click—  
How much of it is truly nourishing?  
How much is engineered to addict, to divide, to manipulate?_  
<br><br>
<br><br>
We´re becoming so disconnected  
—so distrustful.
<br><br>

---
<br><br>
If you give good people **bad information**, 
they make **bad decisions**.
  
<br><br>  
---
<br><br>
### The Great Storytellers
<br><br>
_What if the most dangerous tool humanity ever created wasn´t a **weapon**,  
but a **story**?_
<br><br>
<br><br>
_The ones who **craft the stories** hold the power to influence those,  
who merely know the **facts**._

<br><br>

---
<br><br>
We accept the reality of the world with which we´re presented.

<br><br>

---
<br><br>
_We are **NOT** just a designers._  
<br><br>
Every **choice** we make—every ad, every product, every interface—
ripples far beyond the brief.
<br><br>
<br><br>
_We influence what people desire,  
what they think they need,  
and what they strive for_.  
<br><br>
<br><br>
It’s never just _**aesthetics**_.    
It’s a _**tool**_ to shape _behaviors, beliefs, and systems_.
<br><br>

---
<br><br>
_We are **NOT** just designers._  
_We are **Architects of Culture**._

<br><br>
---
<br><br>
Crisis is time of decisions - _**important decisions**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Decisions we don’t always realize we’re making.  
The danger sneaks in _quietly_.
<br><br>
<br><br>

---
<br><br>
_Don’t be a **stylist** of someone’s story._
<br><br>
<br><br>
And at the end of the day, we want to get _**sedated**_.  
<br><br>
Because it´s painful not to pretend.  
—_we are **cowards**_
<br><br>
<br><br>

---
<br><br>
_Don´t get trapped in **slavery**   
with **distraction** and  
some **comfort**._

<br><br>

<br><br>
## Unlabeled
<br><br>
I´ve never felt like I belong here.  
The chaos and rush make it _hard to breathe_.   
<br><br>
The standards of society make me _**sick**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>

--- 
<br><br>
We _**discover**_ the world through a textbook.   
For years we sit and regurgitate    
what we are told.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Raised not to make a difference in this world.   
Raised to be _**no different**_.  
<br><br>
<br><br>

---
<br><br>

_Keep your head down._   
  
_Follow the rules._  
  
_Do as you´re told._
  
_Play it safe._ 
<br><br>
<br><br>

---
<br><br>
It´so easy to get lost in the _**loud world**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>

---
<br><br>
Chasing _**shiny**_ things.   

<br><br>    
Spamming each other with our burning commentary bullshit,  
_**masquerading as insight**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Hiding behind _**empty polished lables**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
We put this _**civilized mask on**_.  
But when you strip that away, _**what are we?**_
<br><br>
<br><br>
