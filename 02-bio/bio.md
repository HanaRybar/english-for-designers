# This Is Not a Bio
<br><br>
_I’m supposed to tell you who I am._  
_Wrap myself in **shiny words** that look neat and polished._
<br><br>
<br><br>
_**Stick yet another label on a cracked screen.**_
<br><br>
<br><br>
_But what happens when the cracks run too deep?_
<br><br>

**This Is Not a Bio.**   
**This Is a Glimpse Beneath The Surface.**

I´m growing up in a world which is _falling apart_.  
It´s easier to deny it. 
<br><br>
<br><br>
_But we all see it everyday - just take a look around._ 
<br><br>
<br><br>
Clearly I´m not the only one who feels this way.  
_**Crisis is on a RISE.**_

_What makes us so different from every other species on this planet?_  
_What allowed us to rise above the rest?_
<br><br>
<br><br>
Around 70,000 years ago, something _extraordinary_ happened.  
  
— _**Cognitive Revolution**_
<br><br>
<br><br>
Our ancestors leapt ahead, not because they were the strongest or the fastest,  
but because of their unique ability to create _**fictions**_.

<br><br>  
It's the belief in the same fictions that allow us to work together in **HUGE** numbers.
<br><br> 
<br><br> 
_The shared beliefs that make us believe we’re all part of the same group,  
even when we don’t know each other._
<br><br>
<br><br>
**Nations, religions, money**—_they’re all fictions._
