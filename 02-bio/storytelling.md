My story begins where _**the mountains**_ rise sharp against the sky,  
where _**rivers**_ carve deep into the land — and where the human spirit     
still lives _**close to nature**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
_**I owe everything to this place.**_ 
  
To these _**mountains**_,  
the _**wild rivers**_  
and the _**people**_ who surround me.
<br><br>
<br><br>
## The Roots
<br><br>
Growing up, the mountains were _never far away_;  
I spent almost every single moment of free time  
_immersed in nature_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Exploring the deep forests,  
climbing on high mountains,  
observing wild animals.
<br><br>
<br><br>
**It teaches you to _slow down_,  
to be _present_,   
to be _still_.**
<br><br>
To notice the _smallest details_,  
to sense the distant _scent of animals_  
carried by the _breeze_.

—feel the _textures_ of the land  
and _sun on your skin_.
