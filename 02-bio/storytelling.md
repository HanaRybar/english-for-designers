My story begins where _**the mountains**_ rise sharp against the sky,  
where _**rivers**_ carve deep into the land — and where the human spirit     
still lives _**close to nature**_.
<br><br>

_**I owe everything to this place.**_ 
  
To these _**mountains**_,  
the _**wild rivers**_  
and the _**people**_ who surround me.
<br><br>
<br><br>
## The Roots
<br><br>
Growing up, the mountains were _never far away_;  
I spent almost every single moment of free time  
_immersed in nature_.
<br><br>
Exploring the deep forests,  
climbing on high mountains,  
observing wild animals.
<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
**It teaches you to _slow down_,  
to be _present_,   
to be _still_.**
<br><br>
To notice the _smallest details_,  
to sense the distant _scent of animals_  
carried by the _breeze_.

—feel the _textures_ of the land  
and _sun on your skin_.
<br><br>
<br><br>
**It reminds you what really _matters_ in life.**    
_The magic hides in simple things._
<br><br>
<br><br>
Growing up here,  
you learn to respect what surrounds you  
and _gives you life_.
<br><br>
When you take something's life,  
you gain a greater understanding  
and appreciation for it.
<br><br>
Growing your own food,   
and bringing home dinner   
for family and loved ones  
is a _special feeling_.
<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
**I always felt a _deep connection_  
to the _big homestead_ in the mountains  
that _my ancestors_ built.**
<br><br>
_They built it with their own hands._
<br><br>
They didn’t just build a house,  
they crafted a _home_,  
each piece placed with _purpose_,  
meant to last a lifetime.
<br><br>
<br><br>
**I admire their _skills_ —  
not just in what they built,  
but in how they lived  
with _intention_,  
with _care_.**
<br><br>
Up there,  
time moves _slower_.  
There’s space _to breathe_,  
to feel what it means _to truly live_.  
<br><br>
And when people come _**together**_ —    
to help build a roof,  
to split wood,  
to share a meal —  
you see what _**community**_ really means.
<br><br>
<br><br>
**This is the legacy they left behind.  
Not just the house,  
but the _way of life_.**
<br><br>
_The values.  
The strength.  
The quiet resilience._  
<br><br>
<br><br>
## Echoes of the Wild
<br><br>
_That quiet resilience  
is alive in my father._

**Mountaineer.  
Ultra runner.  
Botanist.**
<br><br>
He told me stories  
about distant lands,  
about mountains   
few have seen,  
nights under stars,  
and days spent alone  
in the wilderness.  
<br><br>
He taught me about _**freedom**_.  
And _**loss**_.
<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
_**From him — I got the wild spirit.**_
<br><br>
While other girls wanted to be _princesses_,  
I wanted to be a _climber_.  
An _adventurer_.  
<br><br>
_To hit the road and immerse myself    
in new experiences, new cultures,  
new sights, new smells,  
new people..._
<br><br>
To build my _off-grid cabin,_  
and learn the language of the land.
<br><br>
<br><br>
_**And from my mum — I learned how to live with the shadow of death.**_
<br><br>
A doctor.  
Head of radiation oncology department.  
Surrounded by death every single day.  
  
_**And so was I.**_
<br><br>
<br><br>
I grew up learning to _accept mortality_,  
not with _fear_, but with _peace_.
<br><br>

It taught me to live with awareness.  
To truly appreciate each moment,  
because nothing last forever.
<br><br>
_**When death finds you,  
may it find you alive.**_ 
<br><br>
<br><br>
**For a long time, I didn’t know why  
I loved the things I do.**
<br><br>
_The adventure.  
The challenge.    
The unknown._
<br><br>
<br><br>
I found my _flow state_ through  
pushing _my limits_.
<br><br>
Long-distance running,  
Rock climbing,  
Freediving, ...  
<br><br>
**In those moments, you're right there.  
In the present.  
Alive.**
<br><br>
**There’s no room for _pretense_.**  
<br><br>
_**It brings out the realness  
and rawness of who you are.**_
